    <span class="aboutessay">As a UI/UX designer with technical expertise in front-end web development, 
        I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from 
        Rajadhani Institute of Engineering and Technology Trivandrum, 
        and a specialization in UX through Google via Coursera.
        <br><br>
        My passion for UX extends beyond just designing digital products; 
        I also have a strong interest in user research. 
        I love working with people from different backgrounds to understand their needs and behaviors, 
        and then use those insights to create intuitive and user-friendly designs.
        <br><br>
        In addition to my design skills, I have taken on various leadership roles, 
        including guiding my peers and leading campus communities. 
        I have completed several personal projects in web development and design, 
        and have volunteered for FOSS HACK 2021 as a design volunteer. 
        I was also part of ISP 23 of Internshala, led the TinkerHub campus chapter on my campus, 
        and am currently working with the design team of TH RIET on a voluntary basis, 
        as well as leading GDSC RIET.
        <br><br>
        I have interned at STARVED as a UX/UI designer where I contributed to user research, 
        competitive analysis, wireframing, and prototyping. This experience further honed my 
        skills and provided me with a deeper understanding of the UX design process.
